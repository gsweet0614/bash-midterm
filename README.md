- Log Analyzer

- Overview
`log_analyzer.sh` is a Bash script that helps analyze system log files. It finds errors, critical, and warnings in the log file specified by the user or from the default log file, counts the amount if the user wants that, will count certain warnings if needed, and will log it to a file named log_analysis_results.txt and will create that file if not found.
